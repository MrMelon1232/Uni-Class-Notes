Hash and MAC functions

- how do you know if data has been altered ?

    Use Hash Functions
        - aka message digests
        - input: string M called preimage
        - H(M) = string called hash-value
               -> compact, representative image of the input
            - properties:
                1. Compression
                2. Ease of computation

        Collisions:
            H(M) is many-to-one function
            - t-bit inputs and n-bit outputs | t >> n
            - if H random then 2^(t-n) inputs would map to each output
            - 2 random inputs --> sasme output (collision) w/ probability 2^-n
            - collisions difficult to find computationally
            see C5_class
        
        Desirable properties
            - we want compression and ease of computation
            - pre-image resistance (impossible to determine an input based on given output) | 1-way property
            - second pre-image resistance (impossible to find 2nd input that leads to same output) (need 2^n inputs to guess) | weak collision resistance
            - collision resistance (impossible to find any 2 distinct inputs that hash to same output) | strong collision resistance
                            note: difference here is that both inputs are not fixed
