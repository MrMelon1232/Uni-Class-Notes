Block Ciphers
    - Most used crypto tool
    - Used for:
        1. data confidentiality
        2. MACs
        3. PRNGs
        4. authentication
    - Efficient software/hardware implementations

    Definition:
        - function that maps n-bit plaintext block to n-bit ciphertext blocks
            n is called the blocklength (DES: 64 bits, AES: 128 bits)
        - Parameterized by k-bit key K (chosen randomly)
        Encryption: C = E(M, K)
        Decryption: M = D(C, K)
        - If K is k bits long --> # of keys is 2^k

        1. Encryption func. must be one-to-one
        2. Encryption func. is bijection
        3. Each key defines a different bijection
        4. If each k-bit key is equi-probable (each defines a diff. bijection, entropy of key space is k)
            
        Bijection:
            - one-to-one and onto
                (each element in X (plaintext) maps to at most 1 element in Y (ciphertext))
                (Each element in Y maps to at least one element in X (no one left out))
                TLDR: max mapping from X --> Y == 1
                      All elements in Y are mapped
        
    Practical security
    - Block cipher is:
        1. totally broken if key is recoverable
        2. partially broken if (some) plaintext is recoverable
    - Standard assumption:
        - Attacker has access to all transmitted ciphertext

    Attack analysis
        1. Completixity of attack
            - Data completixity: expected # of required input inputs (ciphertext blocks)
            - Storage completixity: expected # of required storage units
            - Processing completixity
        2. Possible parallelization (comparison)
        3. Computationally secure if:
            a) Data complexity is 2^n: depends on block size
            b) Processing complexity is 2^k: depending on key size
    
    Modes of operation

        1. How to employ block ciphers for large messages
            a) Dividing messages
            b) Padding (adding data to beginning, middle or end) the last block
        2. Basic modes: ECB, CBC, OFB. CFB
            a) Stardardized for DES operations
            b) More modes defined for AES
            c) Can be used with public key encyption
        3. Initialization Vector
            - block of data used in addition to input message
            - randomize encryption process
        
        Electronic Code Book (ECB) (see C4_ECB)
            Encryption E(X) --> C
            Descryption E^-1 (c) --> x

            - identical plaintext (w/ same key) result in identical ciphertext
            - blocks are enciphered independently of other blocks
            - bit errors in a single ciphertext affect decipherment of that block only

            Weakness:
                - Does not hide data patterns (not full scramble ex: image ecnrypted w/ ECB can still be seen (its pattern))
                - Malicious substition of ciphertext is possible
                - Do not use for:
                    - Multi-block messages (requires ind. blocks for ciphering)
                    - keys are reused for more than a single block
        
        Counter mode (CTR) (see C4_CTR)
            - CTR different for each block but same key
            - IV/nonce value used w/ counter for uniqueness (concat/add/XOR) 
            - Software and hardware efficiency: different blocks can be encrypted in parallel
            - Preprocessing: encryption part can be done offline, when msg known we do XOR
            - Random access: decryption of a block can be done in random order, useful for hard-disk encryption


    Design Components:

        Avalanche effect
            - slight change in input causes significant changes to output
            - strongly desired properties of:
                - block ciphers
                - cryptographic hash functions


        Revision:
            Substitution cipher:
                - plaintext is replaced by other characters
                - key = mapping between plaintext and ciphertext
                - adds confusion (makes relationship between key and ciphertext as complex as possible)
            
            Transposition cipher
                - with fixed period t, groups plaintext into block of t chars.
                - applyed to each block a single permutation e on the numbers 1 to t
                - add diffusion (spreading out bits so redundancy in plaintext is spread over ciphertext)

        
        Product cipher
            - execution of 2/+ simple ciphers in sequence such that final product is Cryptographically stronger
            ex: alternating substition and transposition

        Design Approaches
            1. round function is used
                - strong avalanche effect 
                - bijective
            2. Repeated multiple times (n rounds)
                - Round 1 input: plaintext block
                - Round n output: ciphertext block
                - Round key: derived from the key K, for each round
            3. Examples:
                - SP networks (used in AES, CAST-128)
                - Feistel structures (used in DES, RC5, Blowfish)

            Feistel structure parameters
                - block size & key size (large = greater security but slower encryption/Descryption speed)
                - number of rounds (more = greater strength (around 16 rounds))
                - Subkey generation algorithm & round function
                    - greater completixity = greater cryptanalysis resistance

            Data Encryption Standard (DES) (see C4_DES and C4_DES_Overview)
                - most widely used symmetric cipher
                - uses Feistel structure (block length  n = 64 | key size k = 56 | rounds = 16)
                - key size 56 is short now but test of time withstood (no trapdoor found)
                - Alternatives:
                    - Double-DES (no security. adv)
                    - Triple-DES (secure, but slow)
                    - Advanced encryption standard (AES)

            See C4_Multi_Encryption for information and view on multi-encryption
                - encrypts the already encrypted data
            
            AES
                - input block 128 bits in length:
                    16x8 matrix
                - uses round keys that are the result of a key expension (each round is 128 bits)
                - no practical attacks to date / attacks on full AES versions
