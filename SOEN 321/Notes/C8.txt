Domain Fronting

    definition:
        - critical for open web
        - obfuscates (hides) the true domain of an HTTPS connection
        domain of https = how website is read and data transfered
        enables:
            - users to connect to blocked service (via DNS, IP, deep packet inspection)
            - malware to exfiltrate(export) data to unwanted destination

    Tor browser:
        - used for:
            1. privacy (do not use website that reveals like fb)
            2. anti-censorship
            3. protect publisher privacy
        - Tor hidden services allows client and publisher to hide privacy
    
    Can be used for both following:
    Anti-censorship vs malware covert channel

    Some definitions:
        - Content Distribution Network (CDN)
            = geographically distributed network of proxy servers and data centers used for high availability and performance
            TLDR: servers are distributed in order to provide faster transmissions
            ex: if I want to open aws web, my request will be sent to nearest CDN point instead of origin 
        CDN "Origin Pull" see C8_cdnOG
            - PoP server pulls web page data and other elements from origin server
            - In "Origin Push", dev pushes directly to PoP servers


        - DNS, HTTP, HTTPS
            = domain name system: naming system used to identify pc reachable through internet
            = http: application protocol for transmitted data
            = https: secure communication over computer network
        - TLS server name indication (SNI)
            TLS extension for a client to indicate which hostname it is attempting to connect
            Multiple HTTPS sites hosted from same IP address w/ diff certs
        

    How does it work:
        different layers:
            - front domain: used at plaintext layers visible to the censor (DNS, TLS SNI)
            - destination: HTTP layer, not visible to censor, but visible to frontend server

        CDN and fronting:
            - essential for domain fronting
            - CDN'S frontend server (edge server --> allowed.example) on receiving request from ressource not cached forwards request to domain found in host header (origin server)

    Meek Plugin (see C8_meek)
        - blocking-resistant pluggagle transport for Tor
        Steps:
            1. encodes datas stream as sequence of HTTPS requests and responses
            2. wraps HTTP traffic in TLS connection to server hosted in same CDN cloud
            3. CDN server decrypts TLS traffic, identifies hostname in HTTP header and redirects traffic to reflection server
            4. Reflection server reconstructs original Tor traffic from stream and sends to Tor network which routes to true destination

        - everything between meek client and meek server is an opaque data transport to Tor
        - host receives no traffic
        - This is adopted by signal, Tor, Psiphon

        Weaknesses:
            - censor is not crazy (front domain to too important to block)
            - need friendly CDNs
            - traffic analysis (packet length, connection, duration)
            - cost of CDN bandwidth
            - TLS interceptors can cause trouble
    
    Malicious use 

        "Safe" data exfiltration: (see C8_mal)
            - backdoor used Tor hidden services and Meek Plugin to provide secure, discrete remote access
            - full remote control
            - Modified registry to enable RDP
        
        Essentially, security toold are double-edged
