Intro to security
    - Security does not imply privacy 
    - 100% security can't be achieved
    - Systems are designed for functionality and not security
        Therefore security is hard:
            - wrong assumptions about adversary
            - human dependancy
            - human vs machine adversary
    
    Items involved:
        1. software
        2. hardware
        3. networks
    
    Security vs Correctness
        - correctness satisfies system specification   
            reasonable input --> reasonable output
        - security preserves system properties during an attack
            unreasonable input --> not disastrous output ish
        - Main diff: active interference from adversary

    Solution developement is hard:
        - proper threat model design
        - capturing attack capabilities
        - evaluation of security:
            1. dev is bias
            2. No single methodology (since multiple sections of system)
            3. Identifying
    
    Privacy:
        - Security features used for privacy violations
        - Data --> money --> business
        - Conflicts of interest: govt vs private
        - No privacy consideration during system design

    Threat model:
        - look for in-scope and out-scope threats
        - adversarial goals
        - solution goals
        - assumptions about adversary
        - assumptions about environment/user
        - assumptions vs limitations
