Into to cryptography
    - cryptography != security
    - think about 3 perspectives:
        1. defender pov
        2. attacker pov
        3. cost (attack/defend)
    - What is threat model(assumption about system and environment)
        ex: telephone banking PIN vs login password
    - Security is arms race

    Definition:
        - study of math techniques related to aspects of info security
          such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, data origin authentication
        - One set of techniques for info security
    
    Goals:
        1. Confidentiality 
        2. integrity
        3. Data origin authentication
        4. Entity authentication
        5. Non-repudiation (prevention of denying past actions/commitments)

    
    Crytology:
        - cryptography + cryptanalysis = cryptology
        - cryptanalysis = study of code breaking (breaking of crypto system)
        - Good cryptographers know cryptanalysis (must know how systems are broken to create a secure one)

    Models
        1. Communication model
        2. Attacker model
            - passive vs active
            - what ressources does attacker have
            - what does attacker know about system
            - what are assumptions

    Encryptions
        goals:
            1. data confidentiality
            2. protect a large amount of data with short secrets 
            3. Make it difficult for those w/out secret key

        Simple model:
                           c    adversary
            encyption ------ (unsecured channel) -----> decryption
              E(m) = c                                      D(c) = m
                | (m)                                         |
            plaintext source                            destination
        
            - we want to hide key + plaintext
            - d is easily derived from e but not vice versa
            Public key encryption: deriving d from e is infeasible
            Cipher = E & D

    Terminologies:
        plaintext: og msg
        ciphertext: encoded msg
        cipher: algorithm transforming plaintext to ciphertext
        key: info used in cipher (known to sender/receiver)
        encipher (encrypt): plaintext --> ciphertext
        decipher (decrypt): ciphertext --> plaintext
        substitution: each element is mapped into another
        transposition: rearrangement of elements

    kerckhoff's Principle
        1. Security should depend only on the key
            - don't assume that enemy won't know algorithm
            - can capture machines, disassemble programs
            - 2 expensive to invent new algo if its compromised
        2. Security by obscurity doesn't work

    
    How to attack:
        1. Cryptanalysis (search for weakness in algo)
        2. Brute force (try all possible keys (N) avg N/2 trials)
        3. Many others (malware, key/screenlogger, physical)

        Attacks on encryption schemes
            1. Ciphertext-only-attack - deduce the decryption key or plaintext
            2. Known-plaintext attack - using quantity of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext
            3. Chosen-plaintext attack - choose plaintext and is given ciphertext
            4. Adaptive chosen-plaintext attack - chosen-plaintext attack depending on ciphertext received from previous requests
            5. Chosen-ciphertext attack - select the ciphertext and is given plaintext
            6. Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack - chosen-ciphertext depending on plaintext received

    Substitution ciphers
        1. simple substitution
            each symbol in plaintext is replaced by another symbol according to some fixed permutation
            Let A be set of english characters
            Key k(e=d) in K maps plaintext to ciphertext using characters in A
            Key space is all possible mappings, |K| = 26! = 4*10^26

    Brute force key search
        Given ciphertext c, and the cipher used
        For each key k in K
            calculate m' = D(c)
            Does m' look like a real message
                Yes -> done!
                No -> continue
        Expect to try |K|/2 keys before correct match

    Note: E is the most frequency letter and Z the least
          guesses can be made based on relative letter frequencies

    Shift/Caesar cipher
        - Simple substitution cipher
        - Each letter is replaced by another
        For alphabet A, |A| = s
            - e(m) = C = (m + k) mod s, 0 <= i <= s-1
            - d(c) = (c - k) mod s
            - Caesar cipher: k = 3 (shift by 3)

        Congruence relation
            - mod expresses same remainder for 2 argumemts
            a =_ (triple =) b (mod n)
            implies a mod n = b mod n
            (n divides (a-b))
    
    Transposition cipher
        - w/ fixed period t
        - grouping of plaintext in blocks of t characters
        - apply to each block a single permutation e on the numbers 1 to t
        example:
            t = 6, e = (6 4 1 3 5 2)
            m = CAESAR
            c = RSCEAA
            d = (3 6 4 2 5 1)

        - same letter frequencies (essentially rearrangement or order)
