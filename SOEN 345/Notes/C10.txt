Blackbox testing 3

    Decision tables
        - conditions w/ yes/no
        - actions (when they apply)
        - normal state = no actions required
        note: values that don't impact = "Don't care"
        # of columns = # of test cases
        2^n rules with "n" conditions
        for each "don't care" , we use 2^n where "n" is the number of dont care in that column
        then add them all up to get "n" to find # of rules
