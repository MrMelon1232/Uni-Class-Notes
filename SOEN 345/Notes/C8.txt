Blackbox testing
    - testing w/out knowing details, based on specification
    - specification => help test case generation and oracles

    Advantages:
        - no need for source code
        - wide applications
    Disadvantages:
        - not test hidden functions
    
    Error guessing:
        - ad-hoc approach (test cases built to cover error model made from existing errors)
        ex: sorting array  
            error models: empty array, already sorted, reverse-sorted, etc.
            make test cases for these
