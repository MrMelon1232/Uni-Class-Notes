Mechanical Properties of metal

    Stress
        - tensile strength = σ | when item is stretched
        - shear stress | when opposite force is applied on the item
        - formula: load/area
        - applied force
        types:
            1. simple tension | another form: bi-axial (pressurized tank)
            2. torsion
            3. compression | another form hydrostatic (pressure under-water)

    Strain:
        - degree of formation, occurs at low levels of stress
        - measure as changed in length / original length
        - ex: elongation
        

    Stress vs Strain diagram

        Modulus of elasticity (E)
            - reversible
            - how much something will stretch when loaded
            - stiffness of material (high = more stiff) | (stronger bond = stiffer)
            - depends directly on bonding
            Hook's law: 
                σ = E * e
                where e is the strain
            
            - find tangent if not linear

        Poisson's ratio
            - defines how much strain occurs in lateral (x,y) directions when strained in z
            v = - lateral strain / longitudinal strain
            if v > 50, density increases w/ strain | else decreases

            Elastic shear stress
                t = Gy 
                where G = shear modulus
                
                E = 2G(1 + v)

    Plastic Deformation
        - usually after 0.005 strain
        - bonds are broken and stress/strain no longer proportional
        - permanent
    
    Yield Strength
        - stress when noticeable plastic deformation occurs (0.002)
        - change from elastic to plastic
        see C6_yield
    
    Tensile Strength
        - max stress on engineering stress-strain curve (highest pt of stress on graph)
        - max before fracture
    
    Ductility (%EL)
        - amount of plastic deformation at failure
        - amount of deformation possible for material without breaking
            Percent elongation
            Percent reduction in area
    
    Resilience (Ur)
        - ability of material to absorb energy during elastic deformation
        - area under stress curve
    
    Toughness
        - for this chapter, amount of energy absorbed before fracture
    
    True stress
    
    Hardness
        - resistance to surface plastic deformation or scratch
