Polymer structures

    definition:
        - many repeated units | called 'mer'
        - joining process = polymerization
        types:
            1. commercial: used in large quantities (low strength and stiffness) | lightweight
            2. engineering: improved strength and higher temp properties
        - generally plastics are good
        - most polymers are hydrocarbons
            saturated hydrocarbons = each carbon bonded to 4 other atoms
            if double/triple bonds form = unsaturated molecules
        
        Isomerism
            - 2 compounds w/ same chemical formula but diff structures

    Number and weight average molecular weight
        - see C11_molecular
        steps:
            1. sort items in ranges
            2. Find mean weight and # of occurances in each range
            3. compute number and weight fraction
                number = current # of occurence / total # of occurence
                weight = mean weight x # of occurence / sum of all mean weight x # of occurence
            4. compute total molecular weight for number and weight
    
    Degree of polymerization (DP)
        - see C11_dp

    More information:
        Tensile strength increase w/ Mw --> longer chains are entangled better
        % crystallinity: % of material that is crystalline
            --> TS and E often increase with % crystallinity
            --> annealing causes crystalline regions to grow
            --> higher = higher strength
            --> depends on rate of cooling (faster = less crystallinity)
            --> simple structures = more crystallinity
        see C11_crystallinity

        - Structure not strictly straight
        - different chain configs: linear, branched, crosslinked, network
        - changing configs means breaking bonds

        Tacticity:
            - spatial arrangement of R units along polymerchain
            isotactic: R groups on same side
            syndiotactic: R groups alternates
            atactic: R groups random

        Different polymers:
            1. Thermoplastic: soften on heating, long carbon chains, covalently bonded along chain, ductile
            2. Thermo-sets: formed/shaped then cure/set by chemical reaction permanently, hard and brittle
                --> can't be remelted | rigid network of covalent bonds
            3. Eslatomers (rubbers)
            4. Copolymers: 2+ monomers polymerized toegether
    
    Crystallinity in polymers
        - rarely fully crystalline
        - hard for all regions of all chains to become aligned
        - increases with heat treating

        Amorphous polymers: no sudden change on cooling + viscosity increases as temp does down
        Partially crystalline: cooling decreases volume, some parts might form crystalline
        - spherulite structures are formed in semicrystalline polymers
    

    Defects:
        - chain ends
        - vacancies and interstitial
        - screw dislocations
    
    Diffusion
        - gases or organic liquids
        - higher through amorphous regions (less dense)
