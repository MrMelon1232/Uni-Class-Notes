Electrical Properties

    ohm's law: V = IR 
    see C13_equations

    Electrical properties are a consequence of electronic band structure
    --> conductivity depends on # of free electrons and holes
    --> insulators: wide band gap, few electrons excited across band gap 
    --> semi-conductors: smaller gap but more electrons excited

    Imperfections --> increases resistivity (scatters electrons so they dont take direct path)
    resistivity increases with:
        - temp
        - impurity concentration (wt%C)
        - % cold work

    Only electrons that have energy > Fermi (Ef) can be acted on + accelerated when electric field
        --> electrons that participate in conduction process | free electrons
        --> negative charge in conduction band
        hole: charged entity in semiconductors and insulators | energy lower than Ef
            --> positive charge in valence band
        see C13_eh
        intrinsic semiconductions: same # of free electrons and holes
        extrinsic, not the same (occurs when impurities added w/ diff # of valence electrons)

        types:
            1. n-type (n>>p) | donor impurities
            2. p-type (p>>n) | acceptor impurities
        
        - doping increases conductivity
        - forward bias: allows current flow where electrons recombine at junction p-n
        - reverse bias: no flow
