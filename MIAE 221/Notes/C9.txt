Structures and Properties of ceramics

    definition:
        - inorganic, non-metallic materials
        - bonding: ionic or covalent or both
        - generally hard and brittle
        - good electrical and thermal insulators
        - high melting pts and good chemical stability

        reminder: % ionic increases w/ diff in electronegativity
    
    Types:
        1. Refractories: withstand high temp + reactive env
        2. Glasses
            properties (amorphous):
                - note: amorphous = no clearly defined shape/form
                - optical transparency
                - relatively easy manufacturing/shaping
                - hard
                - vacuum tight
                - chemically resistant
            - increase in viscosity w/ temp change and dont show sudden change (like solidfy at spec temp)
            - non crystalline

            Glass are stable at high temp but not room temp
                --> they want to rearrange into crystalline structures but can't
                --> can be done by introducing a nucleating agent and heating treating, we get glass ceramics
            
            Multiple points for viscosity
                - melting pt
                - working pt: glass easily deformed
                - softening pt: max temp that glass can handle w/out alterations
                - annealing pt: residual stress can be removed
                - strain pt: pt at which if under, glass fracture
                - viscosity decreases w/ temp
            
            Heat treating glass
                - annealing: removes internal stresses caused by uneven cooling
                - tempering: compress hot surface to supress growth of cracks from surface scratches
            
        3. Clay Products
            - inexepensive
            - found naturally
            - easy prod
            - often used as mined

            Drying and Frying
                - water removed, inteparticle spacings decreases
                - frying: heat treatment, vitrification: liquid glass forms from clay and flux 

        4. Silicate ceramics
            - quartz
            - combination of Si and O
            - layered silicate: negative charges are balanced by adjacent plane rich in positively
                adjacent sheets bound together by van der waals forces
        
    Fabrication
        - form compacts from powders
        - formed into "green" compact
        - compact then fired/sintered
    
    Ceramic Crystal Structures
        - must satisfy charge neutrality plus size and coordination #
        - cordination # increases with r cations/r anions

        Factors determining structure:
            1. Relative sizes of ions: max # of opposite charged ions
            2. Maintenance charge neutrality (net charge should be zero)

    Bond hybridiztion:
        - when there is significant covalent bonding

    Polymorphic forms of Carbon
        types:
            1. diamond: hardest material, high thermal conductivity
            2. Graphite
                - layered structure
                - in-plane covalent bonds (strong)
                - between sheets (v.d.waals) (weak) 
                Pros:
                    1. good strength
                    2. chemical stability
                    3. low thermal expansion, good thermal shock
                    4. easily machined
                uses:
                    - heating elements
                    - insulators
                    - air purifiers
    
    Defects:
        - vacancies for both cations and anions
        - interstitials for cations (anions are usually big so no interstitials)
            --> this means occupying already occupied space
        - frenkel defect: cation vacancy + interstitial
        - shottky: cation + anion vacancy
        
        - can be solved with substitional cations or anions that represent more than 1 charge
            ex: if we're missing 1 cation, than have a cation that represents 2+
            - we want to maintain electroneutrality

    
    Mechanical Properties
        - brittle  
            --> because compressive strength high
            --> dislocation motion hard

            Fracture toughness: see C9_fracture
            --> improve strength: increase K1c or decrease crack size 'a'
            --> ceramics low fracture toughness

        - Dislocations rare in ceramics:
            - ionic crystals very few slip systems and charge neutrality issues
            - covalent crystals: strong bonding, limited slip systems, complex dislocations
            - TLDR: really need high temp
        
        - use Modulus of rupture to test tensile
            Flexural strength: check C9_flexural
            Porosity Effects and more Flexural strength under pores: see C9_flexural2
        
        - Hardness: hard to measure since ceramics are brittle and easy to crack
        
        - Creep: deformation as a result to exposure to stress at high temps

        - good electrical insulators are good thermal insulators since no conduction electrons
