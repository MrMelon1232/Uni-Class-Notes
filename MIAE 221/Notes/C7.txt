Dislocations & Strengthening Mechanisms

    Plastic deformations
        - occurs by motion of dislocations (edge, screw, mixed) called slip
        - caused by many dislocations under shear stress
        - causes perpendicular dislocation line
    
    Dislocations    
        - make metals weaker
        - but allows for deformations
        - movement is done not in 1 instant (like caterpillar mvt) so atoms dont break apart
        - mvt of dislocation = slip
        - Plane swept out by burgers vector and dislocation = slip plane

        In metals: easy, close-packed planes and directions
            - energy dissipated as heat
        In ceramics: hard, directional | stronger bonds

    Slip systems
        - slip plane + direction
        in FCC: {111} plane and {110} directions
        - FCC and BCC have high # of slips (>12) | ductile and deformable
        - HCP very few slips: brittle 

        In polycrystalline materials
            - many grains, often random
            - slip on grain w/ largest Tr and Tr > Tcrss (crss = critical resolvd shear stress)
    
    Strenghtening mechanisms for metals
        - Dislocation mobility reduced when metal strenghtens/hardens
        - strenghtens by: 
            1. grain size reduction
                - can increase grain boundary
                - increase yield strength, tensile strength + hardness
                - grain boundary acts as barrier 
            2. solid solution strengthening
            3. strain hardening
                - deforming metals at room temp, hardens them
                - percent coldwork CW, as it increases:
                    - yield strength Ïƒy increases
                    - tensile strength TS increases
                    - Ductility decreases
                - same sign dislocatons repulse, opposite attracts
            
                Density = total dislocation length / unit volume
    
    Recovery, Recrystallization and Grain growth
        - heat treating: decreases tensile strength
        3 stages:
            1. Recovery: removal of dislocation
            2. Recrystallization: new grains form w/ low dislocation densities, small, replace parent grains
                - Tr = Recrystallization temp | decreases with CW increasing
                - small grains = strong and tough at low temp | large grains = good resistance at high temp
            3. Grain growth: size increase, small grains dissapear
