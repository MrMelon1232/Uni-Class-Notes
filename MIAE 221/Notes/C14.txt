Thermal Properties

    heat capacity: ability to absorb heat
        - 2 types:
            1. at constant pressure
            2. at constant volume
                generally Cp > Cv
                Cv reaches R constant 
        - Atomic vibrations --> form of phonons (lattice waves)
            --> thermal waves - vibrational modes
    
    Thermal expansion: formula has linear coefficient 1/K or 1/degrees
        --> asymmetric curve: increase in interatomic separation + thermal expansion
            symmetric curve: none of that
        
        Polymers: weaker bonds so = higher coefficient of thermal expansion
        ceramics: low coefficient of thermal expansion

    
    Fourrier's: ability to transport heat (look at equation sheet)
        --> higher in metals
    
    Thermal stress: 
        - caused by:
            1. restrained thermal expansion
            2. temp gradients lead to diff dimensional changes
        (look at equation sheet)
        
    Thermal shock resistance (TSR)
        - occurs from nonuniform heating/cooling
        (look at equation sheet)
