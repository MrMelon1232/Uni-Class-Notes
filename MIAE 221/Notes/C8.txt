Phase Diagrams

    provides information on:
        - melting temps
        - casting
        - alloys + mixtures
        - composition
    
    Solubility limit:
        - max amount of solute that can go in solvent
        - on phase diagram, its the line that separates the other phases from the mixtures
    
    Equilibrium: state of lowest free energy
    Lines in phase diagrams:
        - liquidus: line above only liquid present
        - solidus: same but for solid
        - tie-line: horizontal line going across 2-phase region
    see ex: C8_phases

    Weight factors:
        Wa = Co - Cl / Ca - Cl | Wl = Ca - Co / Ca - Cl
        essentially right to left for substractions (in phase diagram)

    Continually changing composition during slow cooling --> requires solid state diffusion
        --> requires energy and time | if fast, cored microstructure and segragation (only part of it changes)
    
    Mass/weight fraction
        - take volume fraction: Va = va / va + vb
        - Wa = Va*pa / (Va * pa) + (Vb * pb)
            where p = density of phases
        
    see C8_eutectic for example w/ multiple phases (usually 2 phases)

    - Solid solutions at sides of phase diagrams: terminal phases
    - Intermetallic compounds appear as vertical Lines (because of stoichiometry)

    Tranformations:
        1. Eutectic: liquid to 2 solid
        2. Eutectoid: solid to 2 solid
        3. Peritectic: liquid and solid to second solid
    
    Hypoeutectoid: <0.78 wt% C steel | otherwise hypereutectoid | 0.78 wt%C is eutectoid
    pearlite: phase a + Fe3C

    If at non-equilibrium: 
        - might get phases that are not on diagram 
        - phase change might change at diff temps
