Structure of Crystalline solids

    - gases --> atoms no order
    
    Amorphous
        - no repeating bond pattern
        - short range order
        - complex structures, rapid cooling

    Crystalline 
        - repeating 3D pattern (crystal structures)
        - long range order
        - repeated parts are called unit cells (size in nm)
            --> defines basic structural unit (smallest entity)
            --> are prisms
            --> use highest level of geometrical symmetry one (since more than 1 can be chosen)
            --> contains complete lattice pattern
        - arrangement of crystals depend on temperature and pressure (most stable config)
        - patterns = space lattices, defined by unit cells
        ex: metals, many ceramics (except glass), some polymers (can be all 3 including mixed)

    Atomic hard spheres
        - atoms are spheres w/ defined diameters
        - lattice --> 3D array of pts 
    

    Metal Crystal Structures:
        Definitions:
            - Coordination number: # of nearest-neighbor / touching atoms
            - Atomic Packing Factor = Volume of atoms in unit cell (# of atoms * volume of 1 atom) / volume of unit cell
                note: hard spheres = 4/3 pi r^3
                    --> note that 'r' is for the rayon of 1 atom NOT the structure itself
                note: volume of unit cell usually is cube so --> a^3
                note: number of atoms depend on the structure
                for example BCC --> 2 atoms/unit cell since 1 in the middle and 8 corners which form 1
                        but for SC --> 1 atom/unit cell since only 8 corners
            
            For Simple Cubic Structure (SC)
                - rare (only Po has this structure)
                - close packed directions --> cube edges
                - coordination # = 6

        - structures:
            1. Body Centered Cubic (BCC)
                - r = a sqrt(3) / 4
                - # of coordination = 8
                - 2 atoms/unit cell (1 atom, 8 corners)
            2. Face Centerered Cubic (FCC)
                - r = a sqrt(2) / 4
                - # of coordination = 12
                - 4 atoms/unit cell (6 1/2 and 8 corners)
            3. Hexagonal Close Packed
                - # of coordination = 12
                - 6 atoms/unit cell (12 corners, 2 * 1/2, 3 centered atoms)


Thoretical density for metals   
    Density = Mass of atoms in unit cell / total volume of unit cell
            = n * A / Vc Na
            where n = # of atoms/unit cell
                    A = atomic weight
                    Vc = volume of unit cell
                    Na = avogadro #
    
    generally density goes as follows:
        metals > ceramics > polymers


    note: some elements can exist in more than one crystal form (due to temp or pressure)
          - called allotropy/polymorphism

Crystal system:
    - on axes x,y,z --> lattice constants (lenghts of a, b and c)
    - cubic = most symmetry | triclinic least
    vs crystal structure --> system describes only cell geometry while structure has also atomic arrangement
    ex: FCC and BCC belong to cubic system
    as such we have coordinates (111 --> a = 1, b = 1, c = 1)


Crystallographic directions
    - using coordinate system, we can create vectors
    we get formulas:
        U = n (x2 - x1) / a
        V = n (y2 - y1) / b
        W = n (z2 - z1) / c 
        note: n = number that can make these values integers
        format: [111] | brackets with a bar on top of number for negative
        see ex: C3_directions
        w/ brackets <> u can change signs of int
    
    For Hexagonal:
        - 4 axis, a1, a2, a3 and z where the a axis are 120 degrees to each other
        [UVW] --> [uvtw]
        where U = n (a1'' - a1') / a
              V = n (a2'' - a2') / a
              W = n (z'' - z') / c
              
              and 

              u = 1/3 (2U - V)
              v = 1/3 (2V - U)
              t = -(u + v)
              w = W


Crystal planes
    - specified by miller indices (hkl)
    - parallel planes are identical
    h = na / A
    k = nb / B
    l = nc / C 

    - to find indices:
        1. take the 3 coordinate pts
        2. take intercepts (without the variables)
        3. take reciprocal (inverse them ex: 1/2 becomes 2/1) (note 1/inf = 0)
        4. correct them to remove fractions
    
    family of planes: similar planes that have the same atomic arrangement
    - in cubic system only, directions are perpendicular to planes w/ same indices
        ex: [111] direction is perpendicular to (111) plane

Recap for Atomic Packing:
    - packing: arrangement of atoms on different planes and directions
    - linear densities: how packed atoms are in a direction
        formula:
            LD = # of atoms centered on vector / unit length of direction vector
            ex: for FCC --> LD = 2 / (sqrt(2) * a)
    - planar densities: how packed atoms are in a given plane
        formula:
            PD = # of atoms centered on the plane / area of plane
            ex: for BCC --> PD = 1 / a^2
    
    - FCC and HCP are close packed w/ APF = 0.74 (which is max)
    - in planes, FCC --> {111} and HCP --> (0001)


Crystals:
    - single: material made of 1 crystal, unit cells aligned in same orientation
    - polycrystals: many small crystals (grains) w/ diff orientations joined
        grain boundary --> regions where grains meet
        - random oriented --> avg values in all direction

Anisotropy
    - property that varies with direction
    - textured grains

Isotropic
    - proprety that does not vary w/ direction
    - random oriented grains

X-ray Diffraction
    - wave encounters series of regularly spaced obstacles
    - cause wave to scatter or increase/decrease in amplitude
    - diffracted by planes of atoms
    - x-ray = form of electromagnetic radiation
            --> high energy
            --> short wave length
    formula: n lambda = 2d*sin(incident angle)

        distance between similar planes:
            d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)
