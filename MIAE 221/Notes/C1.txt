Introduction to materials

    Our life revolves around:
        - energy
        - materials

    material science:
        - relationship between structures and properties of materials
        - develop and design new materials
        - relationship between processing and structures
    
    engineering: dev processing techniques ad create products

    types:
        1. metals
            - strong
            - high thermal and conductivity
            - opaque and reflective
            Alloy: combination of 2+ metals/non-metals
        2. polymers/plastics (compound of non-metallic elements)
            - soft, ductile
            - low thermal and conductivity
            - opaque, translucent/transparent
            - low density
        3. ceramics (compounts of metallic and non-metallic elements)
            - hard but brittle
            - low thermal and conductivity
            - opaque, translucent/transparent
            - low density

                - increase temp = increase resistivity
                - increase impurity = increase resistivity
                - deformation = increase resistivity

            Electrical properties: Electrical conductivity 
                                metals 
                                semiconductors
                                ceramics
                                polymers

            increase purity = decrease thermal conductivity
            highly porous material = poor conductors (due to big space)

            Magnetic property
                magnetic storage
                magnetic permeability
            
            Optical property
                - light transmittance

            Deteriorative property
                - cracks formed by stress
                - dimished by heat treating
        
        Procedure:
            - ask for:
                1. availability
                2. properties
                3. cost 
            
            1. for specific application --> determine reqs properties
            2. from list of properties --> identify material
            3. find material --> find processing technique
            
    Relationships:
        - Processing affects structure
        - Structure effects hardness
