Diffusion

    definition:
        - diffusion --> mass transport by atomic motion

        mechanics:
            - gas & liquid: random motion
            - solids: vacancy & interstitial

        interdiffusion: diffusion of atoms of one material into another
            -> migrate from high concentration to lower
        self-diffusion: atomic migration in a pure metal


    Diffusionn mechanisms:
        1. Substitutional
            - atoms exchange place with vacancies
            - depends on # of vacancies and activation energy to exchange
            - higher temp = higher # of vacancies and energy | so diffusion is faster
        2. Interstitial 
            - small atoms move spaces in between the other atoms
        
        Carburising:
            - diffusing carbon into steel to harden surface layers
            - requires touch material and hard material that resists to wear

        Case hardening
            - hardens surface
    
    Rate of diffusion:
        J = flux = M / At 
            where M = mass of diffused species
                  A = area
                  t = time
        
        when diffusion flux does not change w/ time, diffusion in = diffusion out
            --> this is called steady-state diffusion
            as such, J = -D dC/dx
        
        for non-steady diffusions:
            dC / dt = d^2C / dx^2
            look at C5_nonsteady for more equations
    
    Diffusion in semiconductors
        doping: diffusion of very small concentrations of atoms of an impurity into semiconductors
        process:
            1. predeposition (deposit P rich layers on surface)
            2. drive-in (heat treat sample to drive P in material)

    
    Diffusion coefficient increases with T:
        D = Do exp(- Qd / RT)
        where:
            D = diffusion coefficient
            Do = pre-exponential
            Qd = activation energy
            R = gas constant [8.314 J/mol-K]
            T = absolute temperature [K]
