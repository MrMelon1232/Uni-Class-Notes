Imperfections in solids

    Solidification:
        - result of casting of molten material
        - nuclei of solid phase form then crystal grow until they meet (crystals become grains)
        grains can be:  
            1. equiaxed (same dimesion in all directions)
            2. columnar (elongated in 1 direction)

            - boundaries: space between grains
                -> here exists atomic disorder and low density
                    1. high atomic mobility
                    2. high diffusivity
                    3. high chemical reactivity

        - crystalline imperfections always exists 
        - defects referes to lattice irregularity

    types:
        1. Point defects (0-D)
            - vacancies (missing atom in structure) | usually low
                Formula of equilibrium concentration (varies w/ temp)
                    Nv / N = exp(-Qv / kT)
                        where Nv = # of vacancies
                              N = # of lattices sites
                              Qv = activation energy
                              k = boltzmann's constant (1.38 * 10^-23)
                              T = temperature
            - interstitial atoms (forced into space)
                - put into space but w/out significant lattice distortions
            - substitutional impurity atoms
                - must follow Hume-Rother rules
        2. Linear defects (1-D)
            - dislocations (makes metals weaker but allows deformation) | (makes atoms misaligned)
            types:
                1. Edge
                    - extra half plane of atoms inserted in crystal structure
                    - b perpendicular to dislocation line
                2. Screw
                    - spiral planner ramp resulting in shear deformation
                    - b parralel to disclocation line

        3. Interfacial defects (2-D)
            types:
                1. Surface (boundary between material and atmosphere)
                2. Grain boundaries (region where grains/crystals join)
                    --> caused by grains having different structures and orientations
                3. twin boundaries (mirror reflections of atom positions of one side of twin plane to other side)
                4. stacking faults (error in stacking sequence)
                5. Bulk/Volume defects (large defects like cracks/pores)
                    --> formed during creation/fabrication
                
                How to observe grain boundaries:
                    1. section/cut
                    2. polish (removes surface features)
                    3. etch (changes reflectance) | really susceptible
                        --> due to atoms at boundary regions being more chemically active
                        --> appears as dark spots
                    4. view (microscope)

    
    Impurity:
        - pure metals hard to make and not often used
        - usually just 99.99%
        - we use alloys, combination of diff metals for increase strength
            --> simplest alloy: solid solution
                    where atoms B are dissolved in atoms A
                        Solvent = major element (host)
                        Solute = minor element (impurity)
            
            - note we can have both substitutional and interstitial
                - substitutional: host atom replaced by diff atom
                    conditions (Hume-Rothery rules):
                        1. delta atomic radius < 15%
                        2. close in periodic table
                        3. same crystal structure for pure metals
                        4. valences (greater tendency to dissolve metal of higher valences)
                - interstitial: impurity atom go into spaces between host atoms

    Composition
        - use weight% --> C1 = m1 / (m1 + m2) * 100
        - use atomic% --> C1' = nm1 / (nm1 + nm2) * 100 | here nm1 --> # of moles
                where nm1 = m1' / A1  
                      m1' --> mass
                      A1 --> atomic weight
        - For conversions (same for both):
            C1 = C1' * A1 / (C1' * A1 + C2' * A2) * 100

        note that : C1 + C2 = 100 | C1' + C2' = 100

        Density: 100 / (C1/p1 + C2/p2)
        Atomic weight: A = 100 / (C1/A1 + C2/A2)


    - Catalysts: increase rate of chemical reaction w/out being consumed
                 -> normally occur at surface defects
    
    Optical microscopy
        - uses light

    Electron microscopy
        - best res = 0.1 um
        - better res than optical
        - tranmission EM: electron beam passes through specimen
        - scanning EM: surface scanned with electron beam, reflected beam collected

    Scanning probe microscopy
        - generates topography map
        - probes raster-scanned accross plane of the surface
    
    Grain size determination
        - intercept method: Avg grain diameter = l / ngM
        where l = equal length line
              ng = # of grain intercepted per line (avg)
              M = scope
            
        - ASTM grain sie number: n = 2^(G-1)
            where G = ASTM grain size #
                  n = avg # of grain size per square inch @ 100x
            G = 1 + log(n)/log(2)
