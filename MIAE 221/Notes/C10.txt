Applications & Processing of Ceramics

    metals are made by:
        - directly casting them into final shape (poured in mold to make)
        - deforming
    
    Ceramics:
        - can't be easily melted
        - can't be plastically deformed into shape
        - different processes possible
    
    Applications
        1. Die blanks:
            - need wear resistant properties
        2. Cutting tools
        3. Sensors
        4. Refractories: mats to be used at high temp
        5. Automobile engines (pros & cons | high temp, low friction loss but brittle, etc)
        6. Nanocarbons
    
    Formations:
        general: formed into compacts from powders and heated to high temp, particles join by atomic diffusion
        - glass forming, sheet forming --> continous casting
        Particulate forming:
            - hydroplastic forming: grind and screen constituents
            - slip casting
            - powder pressing
            - sintering
            - tape casting
        cementation
