Atomic Structure and Interatomic bonding

    atom composition:
        - electrons: 9.11 * 10 ^-31 kg
        - protons 
        - neutrons (total of both: 1.67 * 10^-27 kg)
    
    Atomic mass unit (AMU)
        - 1/12 atomic mass of 12C
        - 1 amu/atom = 1 g/mol

    Atomic weight (wt)
        - 6.023 * 10^23 molecules

    isotopes: atoms w/ 2/+ different atomic masses

    ex1: calculate avg atomic weight of its isotopes (see C2_ex1)

    Material properties --> determined by electronic config

    Eletronic Structure
        - when electrons change energy --> quantum jump to higher/lower energy (absorption/emission)
        - energies quantized --> only specific value of energy
        - energy levels or states --> Bohr model (has limitations)
        - wave-mechanical model 
            --> wave/particle like (not orbital)
            --> shape, size, orientation determined by quantum numbers (3/4 of them)
    
    Quantum numbers
        - electrons characterized by 4 params (quantum numbers)
        - since bohr energy levels separated by subshells --> specified by principal quantum number n
        look at C2_quantum#
        
    Energy states:
        Representations: (see C2_state_summary)
            shapes --> l
                s: orbitals centered
                p: 3 orbitals (dumbells)
                d: complex (5 orbitals)
                f: has 7 orbitals
            # of electron orbitals --> m
                --> takes values of -l and +l
            
        - when magnetic field applied --> subshell split, w/ diff energy | if not same energy
        - outermost unfilled shell contains valence electrons
        when orbitals are full (8 electrons) or are noble gases --> stable


    Periodic table:
        - notes: atomic number = # of protons
        - electropositive (metallic elements) -> give up outer electrons to form cations (cations +) (left of table)
        - electronegative (non-metallic elements) -> accept electrons (anions -) (right of table)
        - losses or gains are usually in the outer layer (less stable areas)
    
    Atomic bonding:
        - bond to reduce overall energy (become more stable)
        - bonding forces (repulsive/attractive)
        Fn = Fa + Fr | Net force = force of attaction + force of repulsion
        equilibrium when Fn = 0
            --> E = integral of F | so F = derivative of E
            so En = Ea + Er
        
        Bonding energy:
            - Eo --> energy required to break bond
                 --> higher bonds = higher strength and melting pt
        
        Primary bonds in solids:
            Chemical (strong)
            
            Ionic
                - between electropositive and electronegative
                - bigger difference = more likely
                - opposites attract --> electrostatic bonding
                - non-directional | ions pack to maintain neutrality (balance)
                - strong bonds = high energy
                - high melting point, hardness, brittle, electrical and thermally insulative
                ex: ceramics
                Formulas:
                    Ea = - A / r
                    Er = B / r^n

            Covalent
                - involves valance electrons
                - directional (only towards atom and another sharing electron)
                    --> so less dense (atoms can't pack together)
                - similar electronegativities (share electrons) (normally s and p)
                - strong and weak bonds

                bond hybridization:
                    - combination of 2+ orbitals 

            Metallic
                - metals and alloys
                - nondirectional electrostatic force
                - free electrons (move freely between ions cores)
                - strong and weak bonds

        
        Secondary bonds:
            
            Van der Waal
                - low energy, weak bonds (exist between all)
                - based on dipoles
                    -> causes boiling and freezing in noble gases
                    -> asynmetrical distribution of electron cloud
                    -> permanent of these = polar molecules
                - hydrogen bonding
                    - causes water to expand when frozen
                    - 4 hydrogen bonds = low density
            
            Permanent dipole bonds
                - one of the strongest Secondary
                ex: surface tension, capillary, vapor pressure, volatility, viscosity
            
        Mixed bonding

            Covalent-Ionic mix
                % ionic character = (1 - e^(-Xa - Xb)^2 / 4) * 100%    
                    where Xa and Xb = electronegativities of elements

        
        Properties related to bonding
            1. Melting temperature
                - larger Eo = larget Tm
            2. Elastic Modulus
                - larget Eo = larget E (elastic modulus)
            3. Thermal expansion
                - smaller Eo = larger al
