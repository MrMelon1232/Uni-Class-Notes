Optical Properties

    definition
        - light = electromagnetic wave

    properties:
        - wavelike characteristics
        E = hc / Î» or hv

        light interaction w/ solids
            - incident light is:
                1. reflected
                2. absorbed
                3. scattered
                4. transmitted
            Io = It + Ia + Ir + Is
        
        when emitted light same energy and phase as inciden light - coherent
        
        Classifications:
            1. transparent
            2. translucent
            3. opaque
        
        - metals can absorb almost any frequency of light 
            --> since many electron states
            --> transmitted if thinner than 0.1 um
        - also reflects light well (opaque and reflective)
            --> electron transition from excited state produces photon
            --> reflected at same weavelength

        For non metals:
            - reflection distorts electron clouds
            n = c/v 
                where n = infex of refraction
                      c = veclocity of light in vacuum
                      v = velocity of light in medium
            - large ions decreases speed
            internal reflectance: n1/n2 = sin(o1)/sin(o2)
        
        Scattering in polymers:
            - amorphous + pore free = no Scattering
            - semicrystalline = scatters
        
        Absorption in semiconductions 
            - same with insulators
            - light absorbed if gap < 1.8eV (opaque) | gap > 3.1eV no absorption (transparent)
            - between --> partial absorption and material is colored
        
        Translucency:
            - light may be reflected again since scattering can occur inside
            - scattering causes:
                1. grain boundaries
                2. fine pores
                3. diff phases
        
        Luminescense
            - reemission of light by material
            - light reemitted is at lower frequency
        
        Photoconductivity:
            - can increase # of charge carriers by absorption light
            - so more electrical conductivity
