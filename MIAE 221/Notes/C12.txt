Polymer Application and Processing

    reminder for plastic:
        - really good material
        - low cost
        - noise reduction
        - low friction

    3 types of behaviour:
        1. elastic-fracture (like ceramics)
        2. elastric then plastic (like most metals) | high temp, not recoverable (viscous)
        3. totally elastic | low temp

        Stress-strain behaviour:
            - elastic modulus lower than metals
            - tensile strength is about 10% of metals
        
    Drawing
        - stretches polymer prior to use
        - aligns chains in the stretching direction
        - increases E and TS but decreases %EL
    
    Longer chains = more entanglement so increase in TS (also brittleness)
                                    --> also degree of crystallinity since closer bonds

    Elastomers:
        - low E 
        - entropy decrases w/ straightening | increase when returned to more disordered state
        - increase in temp when stretched

    Vicoelastic: in between, polymers behave like rubbery solids, non-linear elastic

    Craze:
        - formation prior to cracking
    
    - Ductile above Tg, brittle below Tg
    - Strain rate slow = ductile | strain rate fast = more brittle

    2 types of polymerization
        1. Addition/chain
        2. Condensation: 2 diff molecules come together
    
    Applications:
        - Elastomers
        - fibers
        - adhesives
        - coatings
        - films

    Polymer processing:
        - compression, injection molding, extrusion
