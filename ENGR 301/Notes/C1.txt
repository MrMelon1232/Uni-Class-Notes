    Organization Structure
        - 2 types of view: Macro(big picture) and micro (details)
        - organizational theory explains trade-off of macro and micro

        types:
            1. Functional organization (by function)
                - coordinated by functional & upper level of management
                - when design and construction dont overlap
                - 1 clear superior
                Pros:
                    - stability and prof standards
                    - latest technology, corporate memory, good discipline control
                Cons:
                    - poor communication accross functions
                    - low adaptability
                    - resistance to change
                ex: universities, government, armed forces

            2. Projectized organization
                - based on projects
                - most organization's ressources are involved
                - manager --> independance and authority

            3. Matrix organization  
                - mixed of project and functional (ex: u could have functinal separation but have project managers as staff interact with other functional departments)
                strong --> max power to project managers (more projectized) | have a group of managers
                weak --> max power to functional managers (more functional)
                - scpoe, cost, schedule --> taken care by project managers
                - func objectives (QA, design standards, policies) --> taken care by functional managers
                Pros:
                    - pros of functional and projectized orgs
                    - corporate memory
                    - good env for new project managers
                Cons:
                    - difficult defining accountability
                    - multiple bosses (violate unity command principle) (strong bosses dominate)
                    - high admin and admin cost
