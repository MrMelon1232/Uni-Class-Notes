Project devlivery methods and contracts
    
    3 types:
        1. Traditional: design activities are completed, then build starts
            - single contractor
            - longest
        2. Phased: respected build activities start when their design activity is complete
            - multiple contractors, req PM
            - mid duration
        3. Fast Track: build activities start during design activities
            - multiple contractors
            - shortest duration
            - hard to manage, inadequate design + schedule
    
    Contracts
        - used for: describe scope of work, project duration, specify payment
        - sets control mechanisms, manage/allocate risks, assign responsabilities/
        - a legal relationship (obligation between owner and performing org to execute scope)
        - verbal/writing (must be in writting for a sale of land)
        contains:
            1. names
            2. scope of work
            3. period
            4. price, method, terms
            5. language, source of law gvt
            6. listing of other docs

        proof:
            - mutual agreement
            - consideration
            - legal

        types:
            1. Lump sum
                - high risk to seller/contractor
                - when we can state the entire cost before build
                - also includes profit
                - paid by percentage of work done
                - markup is usually higher to account for risk
                formula: direct cost + indirect cost + markup
                Cons:
                    - not flexible (details b4 work done (traditional delivery))
                    - deviations handled as change order
                    - engineer estimates quantities for work items | contractor quotes price by unit for each work items
            
            2. Unit price
                - when not possible to calculate exact quantity of materials
                - best for when design responsability remains with the owner/design completed during construction
                - lower risk than lump sum
                - broken down into work items
                - Total price = sum of work items prices
                - Work item prices = quantity * price-per-unit
                - when actual quantity differs estimated by more than 10%, unit price renegotiated
                Cons:
                    - true contract price not known until project completed
                    - can be 
                    
            3. cost + fixed percentage or fee or profit sharing or sliding fees

                cost + fixed percentage:
                - contractor reimbursed for all direct expenses + paid percentage of that cost as fee
                - best for contracts with new technology but not time limited
                - risk toward owner

                cost + fixed fee:
                - same reimbursement as previous
                - contract gets fixed fee for expertise (usually a percent of original estimated total cost)
                - owner risk in direct cost
                - contractor loses money if project is delayed (we want to finish ASAP)

                cost + fixed fee + profit sharing:
                - share any underrun savings but no penalty for overrun
                - specify target price, if under --> share profit between owner and contractor
                - common contractor gets 25% of the amount left

                cost + fixed fee + sliding fee:
                - bonus for under-run and penalty for overrun
                - Sliding Fee = R (T - A)
                    where R = base percent value
                          T = target price
                          A = actual cost 
        
        Provisions:
            - in contracts
            - assign responsability for covering the costs of possible/unforseen circumstances
            ex: force majeure (earthquakes), insurances, liquidation damages
