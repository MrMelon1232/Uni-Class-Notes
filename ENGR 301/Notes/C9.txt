Economic Decisions, Cash flow diagrams, interest and equivalence

    - principal: initial amount of money involved in debt/investment
    - plan for receipts or payments: cash flow pattern over a specified length of time
    - future amount of money: end value

    Variables
        i = interest rate per interest period
        n = number of interest periods
        P = a present sum of money or present value/worth
        F = future sum of money, n interests periods from the present, (its p with interest i)
        A = end of period in a uniform series continuing for n periods

    Problems:
        - simple
        - intermediate (primarily economic)
        - complex
    
    engineering costs:
        - fixed costs
        - variable costs
        - marginal costs (var cost for 1 more unit)
        - avg costs
        Total cost = total fixed + total variable
        - chart for revenue --> when cost = revenue (breakeven point BEP)

        others (sunk cost, opportunity costs, recurring, incremental, etc)
    

    Cash flow diagrams (CFD)
        - costs/benefits of engineering over time
        - basis of engeering economic analysis
        - draw a horizontal line, divided into time units
        - for each cash flow, draw a vertical arrow (up for profit, down for cost)


    Interests and Equivalence
        1. Simple interest --> applied only to the original sum
            interest earned = P * i * n
            F = P + P * i * n

        2. Compound interest
            - usual method
            - calculated on the accumulated amount (compounding process)
            F = P(1+i)^n 

        3. Equivalence
            - equivalence of present to future/past values
            - dependent on interest rate
            - finding present value to have in order to have a specified future value (discounting process)
            function: P = F(1+i)^-n

    Types of cash flow (look at C9_models)
        - use compound interest table for diff interest at different number of periods
        - diff periods are additive
    
    Uniform series
        - cash receipt or disbursement in a uniform series
        - ex: annual contribution
        - use table to get the interest amount
        - for sinking fund factor, calculate manually see slide 5
    
    Multiple factors: look at slide 5 for info
    note: Gradient descent = continuous increase per year for example or a period
