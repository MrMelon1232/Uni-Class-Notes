Earned Value Management


    EVM:
        - project control technique
        - integrates scope, cost, schedule
        - measure performancee of a project at any point in time

    Cost schedule plan:
        - plot of project's planned cummulative costs
        - usually S shape ---> referred to as S-curve

        Actual vs budgeted: 
            PV: planned Value | planned budget to be used for the work or scheduled cost
            AC: actual cost
            EV: earned Value | earned budget depending on work done (% complete * total budget cost)
            ST: scheduled time | EV/PV * AT
            AT: actual time
            BAC: budget at completion | total PV of a project
            
            CV: cost variance | cost performance on a project | EV - AC
                - CV positive --> under budget | negative --> over budget
            SV: schedule variance | measure of schedule performance of project | EV - PV
                - SV positive --> ahead of schedule | negative --> behind schedule
            CPI: cost performance index | cost efficiency to work | EV / AC
                - more useful than CV when comparing diff pts in time or diff projects
                - CPI > 1 --> cost underrun | cost inefficiency = 1/CPI = AC/EV
            SPI: schedule performance index | measures progress achieved | EV / PV
                - SPI > 1 --> more work done then planned
            ETC: estimated to completion | (BAC - EV) / CPI (assume remaining future follows past CPI)
                - assume CPI = 1 if we assume current variance is atypical(not representative) to future variances
                - EV should be equal to AC for remaining period if CPI = 1
            EAC: estimated at completion | EAC = ETC + AC | EAC = BAC / CPI
            CSI: cost schedule index | EV * EV / (AC * PV) | | on target if CV cancels SV
            TV: time variance | ST - AT
            TPI: time performance index | ST/AT
    
    Cost control:
        - detect cost overrun
        - timely corrective actions to minimize/elminate cost overrun
    
    S-Curve (PV Curve)
        - predicting project cash flow reqs
        - planned cost = budget (PV)
        - planned time = schedule
