Nominal (r) and Effective (i) interest rates

    nominal (r)
        - interest rate w/out consideration of compounding
        - not amount of rate that will accumulate per year
        interest rate per month = r / m (rate / # of months)

    effective (i)
        -interest rate takes compounding into consideration
        i = (1 + r / m)^m - 1
        per payment period: i = (1 + r / ck)^c - 1
                where m = # of compounding periods per year
                      k = # of payment periods per year
                      c = # of compounding periods per payment period 
                      m = c*k
    
    look at slide 6A for examples
    important to really understand the problems and look for variables



Changing interest rates (see slide 6B)
    - apply formula to present money with current interest rate
    - then apply the new interest rate on the value money after n periods
    ex: interest first 2 years = 12%, after 9%, find future value at year 5
    find P at 2 years, then use P at 2 years to find F at 5 years

Present worth analysis
    - helps find present worth of future costs and benefits
    Assumptions in solving economic analysis problems:
        1. end of period convention (all cashflow amounts are calculated as amounts at the end of each period)
        2. no sunk costs (consider current and pentential future only)
        3. 2 viewpoints (investor and borrower)
    
    techniques:
        1. equal lives (useful life of each alternative equals analysis period)
        2. not equal lives
        3. infinite analysis period

        present worth analysis requires that analysis is made between equal time periods

        what we want in an alternative:
            - Max net present worth (present worth benefits - present worth of costs)
            NPW = PW of benefits - PW of costs
        
        for not equal lives: 
            - use LCM (least common multiple of lives)
            - TLDR: repeat the cycle in that multiple
            ex: 10 year project vs 5 year
            LCM: 10 years --> reformulate the 5 years into 10 years (essentially 2 times the 5 year period)
