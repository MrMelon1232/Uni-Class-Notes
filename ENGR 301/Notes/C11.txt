Annual Cash Flow Analysis


    3 analysis methods:
        1. Present worth / net present value (NPV)
        2. Annual cash flow
        3. Rate of return / internal rate of return

    For annual cash flow:
        - we want to compare alternatives
        - convert present values to equivalent uniform values

        salvage value:
            - 1 time cash flow benefit at the end of asset's life
            - when there is an initial cost (P) followed by a salvage value (S) 
                --> equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) (installation, operating expenses, etc) | (becomes negative amount)
                EUAC = P(A/P, i, n) - S(A/F, i, n)

            EUAC = PW Cost (A/P, i, n)
            - Expenditure of money increases EUAC
            - Receipt of money decreases EUAC 

            EUAB --> for benefits (savings, salvage value, etc)
            EUAW = EUAB - EUAC

            we want to:
                1. Max EUAB
                2. Min EUAC 
                3. MAX EUAW

        annualized salvage values and installation, the rest are already done


    Types of analysis periods
        - alternatives have equal lives
        - alternatives have unequal lives
        - no need for common analysis period between alternatives 
        2 assumptions:
            - AC of future instance = same as current instance
            - common multiple of useful lives exist

        since multiple of finite service life = 1 service life
            --> EUAC inf = EUAC limited life
            but for alternative w/ inf life --> EUAC inf = Pi + other annual costs


Rate of return

    - when present worth & EUAW = 0 (benefit = cost)

    decisions are based on: minimum attractive rate of return (MARR)
    IRR (internal rate of return): interest reate which equates to 
        sum of present value of cash inflows + sum of present value of cash outflows
        - discount rate tjat causes NPV = 0
        - higher IRR = better    

        PW of benefits - PW of cost = 0
        PW benefits / PW cost = 1
        Present worth = Net present worth = 0
        EUAW = EUAB - EUAC = 0

    
    when finding interest rate, set NPW or PW to 0 and solve for rate or use EUAB - EUAC = 0 and use trial and error
    see C11_IRR_EX1 and C11_IRR_EX2 C11_IRR_EX3 for examples

    Incremental Analysis
        - for evaluating multiple alternatives
        - different between alternatives = increment
        if delta IRR > MARR --> choose higher initial cost
            else chose lower initial cost
