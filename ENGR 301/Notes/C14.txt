Inflation

    - makes future money less valuable than present
    - increase = deflation

    depends on:
        1. money supply
        2. exchange rates
        3. cost-push (incrase operating cost = increase sell price)
        4. demand-pulls

    definitions:
        1. inflation rate: annual rate of increase in price
        2. real interest rate: increase in purchasing power (exlcude inflation effect)
        3. market interest rate: rate obtained in marketplace (combines inflation and real interest)
    
    avg inflation "f"
        f = (Pn / P0)^(1/n) - 1
        where Pn = base * inflation percent n * inflation percent n+1 ...
    
    rates and dollars:
        i = i' + f + i'*f where 
            i = market interest rate
            i' = real interest rates
            f = inflation
        
        actual dollars: physical money / inflated dollars
        real dollars: constant dollars representing purchasing power (inflation-free)
    
    Cost indexes:
        - must use standard purchasing power base of money to compare 2 diff years of money
        - better than predictors
        --> use price change indexes
            % increase = (new - old) / old * 100
            F = P (1+i)^n --> f = (F/P)^(1/n) - 1

        2 types:
            1. composite: track historical price bundles of assets
            2. commodity: ex: construction labour, iron-ore
