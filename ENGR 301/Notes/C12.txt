Other analysis techniques

    Future worth analysis:
        - analysis at some future point in time
        - find F given A, G, etc

    Benefit-cost ration analysis
        - PW of benefits / PW of costs >= 1
        - between 2 alternatives --> if delta B / delta C >= 1 choose higher-cost alternative

        note: salvage value = value gained at the end of period
                            usually used (A/F, i, n)
    
    Payback period
        - interest rate not considered
        - approximation
        - economic consequences beyond payback ignored

        steps:
            - find the period/time it takes to cover cost
            - find min period option

    Sensitivity Analysis
        - when we want a change in the future so we determine what current action to take
    
    Break-Even Analysis
        - cost = benefit, you break even
