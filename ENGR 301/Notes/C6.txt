Scheduling of Projects

    Project schedule:
        - sum of all activities
        - in sequence
        - schedule: plan that indicates what needs to be done, ressources to use, timeline

        3 roles:
            1. aid in planning project implementation
            2. commununicate aspects of project exec progress
            3. basis of controlling implementation

        Representing schedules: simpler = better

        Categories
            1. pictorial charts (simple but limited in details)
            2. gantt charts 
            3. linear schedules
            4. network diagrams


        D = A / PT
            where D = activity duration
                  A = units of work
                  P = Productivity rate (unit of work/hour)
                        - found by historical data
                        - factors affecting it: project conditions, learning curve, weather conditions
                  T = number of crews
        
        Network diagrams:
            2 types:
                1. PERT (project evaluation and review technique)
                    - uses probabilistic (uncertain) estimates of activity durations
                    - activity-on-arrow network (AOA) (events as nodes and activities as arrows)
                2. CPM (critical path method)
                    - uses deterministic (certain) estimates of activity durations
                    - activity-on-node (AON) (activities as nodes and events as arrows)
    
        Steps on drawing activity network:
            Ask for each activity on the list:
                1. Is it a "start" activity
                2. precedence
                3. concurrence (what activity can start/finish after)
                4. sucession (what activities can begin after this one finished)

            We then label at table:
                PIB: preceded immediately by
                - only 1 start and 1 finish activity (dummy could be used if we have multiple)
