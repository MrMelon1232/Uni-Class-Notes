Project Delivery Systems
    
    definition:
        - system used by agency or owner
        - for organizing, financing design construction, operations and maintenance services
        - done by entering into legal agreements
    aka: contracting method, contract strategy, procurement strategy
    - helps transfer risks to project participants

    Types:
        1. Tranditional (design-bid-build |DBB|) --> owner generates design specs, selects lowest bid
            - 2 contracts: single designer and single general contractor (has its own contracts)
            - contract types include: lump sum, unit price, cost plus fixed fee contract for contractors
        
        2. Turnkey (complete project)
            - design-build --> generates req specs, selects lowest bid, single contract
            - design-manage --> generates req specs, selects lowest bid, single contract for managing
            - 1 contract, engineer and contractor (construction manager for design-manage) (they get multiple contracts)
        
        3. Owner-builder    
            - 2 contracts (design and execution)
        4. Professional Construction management
            - general contractor (2 contracts: designer and general contractor)
                = 3 party team of 
                = separate designer and general contractor (GC) acting as construction manager
                = lump sum or negotiated contracts
                = some of his own force but mainly subcontractors
            - project manager

    
    Planning
        - define project by scope
        - serves project manager as a map

    Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
        - deliverable oriented grouping of project elements
        - work not in WBS = outside scope of project
        - hierarchical
        - broken down into work packages 

        Work packages
            - well defined scope of work that usually terminates with deliverable product
            - vary in size but measurable and controlable unit of work
            - mutually exclusive + collectively exhaustive
