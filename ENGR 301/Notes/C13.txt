Depreciation

    Income:
        - Revenue - Cost to obtain

    defined as:
        - decrease in value by:
            1. decline in market value
            2. decline in value to an owner
        must be:
            1. used to produce Income
            2. useful life
            3. decays/loses value
        - business costs are either expenses or depreciations
        - non-cash cost
        - business expense over longer period

    Types of property
        1. Tangible --> can be seen, touched (real)
        2. Real --> land, buildings, all things built, grown etc on land
        3. Personal --> equipment, furnishing, vehicles, etc (tangible but not real property)
        4. Intangible --> can't be seen or touched (patents, copyrights, franchises, etc)


    Exceptions:
        1. land never depreciates
        2. Leased property
        3. factory inventory

        cost basis of an asset
            - total charge that must be spent over the life of an asset
            Book value = cost basis - depreciation charges till date

    In canada --> Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)
    
    Methods:
        1. straight line --> for intangible asset
            d = (B-S) / N
                - d = depreciation charge annual
                - b = cost basis
                - S = salvage value
                - N = depreciable life in years
                see ex: C13_SL_EX

        2. sum-of-year digit (SOYD) --> general
            SOYD = N * (N + 1) / 2
            d = (N - t + 1) / SOYD * (B - S)
                - d = depreciation charge in any year t
                - N = number of years in depreciable life
                - B = cost of asset 
                - S = estimated salvage value after depreciable life
            to find book value of asset in a year, subtract each depreciation charge until specified year (including the year we want to find)

        3. declining-balance --> general
            - like negative interest rate, constant depreciation rate "D"
            - dn = D * B (1-D)^n-1 = D * BVn-1 | P = BV n = 0 
            look at formula: C13_declining_formulas
            B1 = B0 - d1 .... Bn = Bn-1 - dn

        4. double declining-balance --> general
            - 150% --> dt = 1.5/N * B at t-1
            - double --> dt = 2/N
            note: salvage value indicates the end value

        5. unit-of-production --> machinery
            - based on use
            UOP = (production for year / total lifetime production) (B-S)

        CCA
            - asset-class accounting
            - maximum capital cost allowance --> max company could take would be sufficient to reduce the taxable income to 0
            - first year ownership rule --> only 50% of maximum rate
            - CCA --> claimed by completing the CRA form shedule 8 | schedule II = income tax guide
