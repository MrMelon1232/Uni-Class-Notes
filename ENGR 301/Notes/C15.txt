Taxation

    taxable income = gross income - deductions
        where:
            gross income = wages and salary, interest income, etc
            deductions = pension, retirement plans
    taxes are progressive (more money = more tax)

    Avg tax rate = total taxes payable / taxable income
        where:
            total taxes payable = fed + prov + surtaxes
        
    marginal tax rate = tax rate that applies to next taxable dollar (tax bracket)

    Corporate income tax:
        - not progressive
        - small business deduction (SBD) on the first 300k
        - diff around the world
        - only corporate companies (not sole, partnership)

    
    MARR
        - before and after
        - MARR after-text = MARR before-text * (1 - t)
        same for IRR
        UCC opening + additions - disposals - CCA = UCC ending
    
    look at C15_tax_depreciation example
    look at C15_CCA_TAX example


    CTF and CSF
        - capital tax factor: constant for given CCA rate and interest rate
            - summarizes effect of benefit of future tax savings due to CCA
            - use for PRESENT
        - capital salvage factor: used when asset is salvaged or scrapped as an ongoing tax effect
            - when salvaged or scrapped, not half year rule
            - use for FUTURE

        formula:
            CSF = 1 - td / (i + d) 
            CTF = 1 - tf (1 + i/2) / ((i + d) ( 1 + i))
                where:
                    t = tax rate
                    d = CCA rate
                    i = after-tax interest rate
            
            PW of salvage value/sale =  salvage Base * CSF * (P|F, i or MARR, n)
