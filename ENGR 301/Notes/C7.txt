Cost Estimating

    Why estimates:
        - obtain contracts
        - establish budget/feasibility

    types:
        - estimates for conceptual planning: based on general paremeters of facility size, anticipated quality of construction and use of facility
        - estimates for feasibility: based on preliminary design information
        - estimates during engineering and design: based on schematic design and docs
        - estimates for project execution/construction: prep using historical average costs
        - estimates for change orders: developed using project implementation in response to owner change in project scope

    Contingency:
        - amount added to an estimate to allow unlikely situations (additional cost)
        - based on estimator's past project experience
    
    Details:
        - direct cost (labor, material, etc)
        - indirect cost
        - markup
    
    Estimating models:
        1. triangulation: diff perspective approach
        2. Learning curve: percentage or rate at which output is increased due to repetition
            Tn = Tinitial x Nr

            where Tn = time required for Nth unit of production
                  Tinitial = time required for first unit of prod
                  N = number of completed units
                  r = learning curve exponent
                    = log (learning curve as decimal) / log 2.0
        
            when ouput 2x --> decrease to learning rate (L%) for last item
            see C7_learningCurve for examples 
        
        Types of cost estimating:
            1. Rough
                - used in initial planning and evaluation phase
                - finding magnitude
                - quick, no detail
                - accuracy -30% to +60%
            2. Budget
                - used in conceptual and preliminary stage of project
                - more detailed than Rough
                - accuracy -15% to +20%
            3. Detailed
                - used in detailed design and contract bidding phase
                - more time and ressources
                - accuracy from -3% to +5%
        
        Difficulties:
            1. one-of-a-kind: a lot of customization
            2. time and effort
            3. estimator expertise

        More models:
            - Per-unit model 
                - uses per unit factor 
                - simple and useful
                - only for Rough estimates
            - Segmenting model
                - divide into components
                - total = sum of components
            - Cost indexes
                - change in price over time
                - Cost at time A/ cost at time B = index at time A / index at time B
            - Power-sizing model    
                - estimate costs of industrial plants and equipment
                - Cost of equipment A / cost of equipment B = (Size (capacity) of equipment A / Size (capacity) of equipment B)^x
                    where x = economies of scale in size/capacities
                    if x = 1 --> linear relationship | if x > 1 --> diseconomics of scale | if x < 1 ---> economics of scale
                - works best in middle range
