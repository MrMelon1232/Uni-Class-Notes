Design concepts and principles

    principles:
        - no tunnel vision
        - no reinvention
        - uniformity and integration
        - structured for changes
        - assessed for quality during changes
        - reviewed to minimize conceptual errors
    
    Concepts:   
        - Abstraction
        - Refinement 
        - Modularity (compartmentalization of data/func)
        - Procedure (algo)
        - Hiding (controlled interaces)
    
    Independence:
        - cohesion: degree to which module performs only one function
        - coupling: degree to which module is connected to other modules
     
    We wamt to hide information:
        - Encapsulation = high quality design
        - limit global impact and side effects
