Software Quality

    quality of design: reqs, specs, design
    quality of conformance: implementation
    - creates useful product that can measured by creator and users
    McCall's quality factor model
        1. Product operation
            - Correctness (meet reqs)
            - Reliability
            - Efficiency
            - Integrity (ease of use)
            - Usability
        2. Product revision
            - Maintainability
            - Flexibility
            - Testability
        3. Product transition
            - portability
            - reusability
            - interoperability (interactions)
        
    - effective software process --> infrastructure that produces high quality product
    - umbrella, software techniques and management contributes, quality control and assurance
    - useful product --> delivres content, func, features that users want

    Costs:
        1. Prevention (planning, reviews, test, training)
        2. Internal failure (rework, repair)
        3. External failure (return and replacement, complaints, warranty, help support)
        - costs more from 1-3 w/ 1 being lowest



Interface design

    process:
        1. use, scenario dev
        2. interface structure design
        3. interface standards design
        4. interface design prototyping
        5. interface evaluation
