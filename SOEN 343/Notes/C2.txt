Unified Process (UP)

    - goal: enable production of high quality software that meet needs within time/budget
    - iterative development
        - short fixed-length mini-projects (move tasks next iteration if deadline 2 hard)
        - each iteration outcome --> tested, integrated, exec system
        - each cycle ==> reqs, analysis, design, implementation and testing
    
    - embraces changes (change of reqs, rapid feedback, modify/adapt)
    - UP recommends 2-6 weeks duration per iteration

    Phases:
        1. Inception (define scope)
        2. Elaboration (plan, specify features, baselines architecture)
        3. Construction (build product)
        4. Transition (product --> end user community)

        - Each phase has risk mitigation and milestone
        - milestone review helps ensure we are on right track
        - iteration walk through all disciplines
