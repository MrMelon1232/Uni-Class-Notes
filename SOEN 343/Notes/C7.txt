System Sequence diagrams

    UC specifies function-ality
    UC scenario is a time-ordered series of function calls invoked by actor
    Key tasks:
        - identify functions in UC scenario
        - translate them to UML 
        - draw sequence diagrams
    
    Definition:
        - diagram that models scenario executing in system
        - for use cases
        - participants and message in horizontal axes (vertical being time)

        notation for actors see C7_actors

        Messages:
            1. Synchronous message (arrow filled) caller waits for receiver b4 sending other
            2. Asynchronous message (arrow not filled --> just naked) opposite of synchronous
            3. can add return message going back to box (instantiation of objet)
            4. Message can create participant
                ex: [obj 1]
                       |
                       |
                      [ ] ---- <<create>> ----> [obj 2]
                                                   |
                                                   |
            5. Destroy --> delete participant (add big X at end of arrow)
            6. Can send to own self (reflexive)
