Interaction design (IxD)

    bad designs:
        - buttons are too similar or close
        - no distinction, no instruction, etc
        TLDR: u want to address user needs
        ex: hotel phone
            - infuriating
            - confusing
            - inefficient, too many steps for basic function
            - no indicator for messages left
            - instructions not clear
    
    definitions:
        - design for interactive products to help people (consider where, who, what)
        - understand users (emotions, needs, business, technology, marketing, etc.)
        - multiple teams (engineers, designers, psychologists, product managers, etc.)
            AKA multidisciplinary
        - note: IA = information architecture (how app is structured)
        positives vs negatives:
            - more ideas/designs generated
            - creative and og designs
                        vs
            - hard to communicate and progress with design
            - confusion when diff languages, values
            - complex and costly

    questions to ask
        - what are people good/bad at
        - what can help people with what they document
        - improvements, what people want

    some design practices contributing to IxD:
        - graphic
        - product
        - artist
        - industrial
        - film industry
    
    processes that do IxD:
        - HCI
        - human factors
        - cognitive engineering
        - cognitive ergonimics
        - information systems
    
    General Process:
        1. users involved
        2. identity UX and usability
        3. Iteration through activities

User Experience
    7 factors that describe UX:
        - useful
        - usable
        - findable
        - credible
        - desirable
        - accessible
        - valuable
    - how product is behaved and used by people (emotions and attitudes towards it)
    - pragmatic: simple, practical and obvious to use
    - hedonic: evocative, stimulating interaction is to users

    consider:
        1. accessibility (accessible to users)
            ex: focus on disabilities (VR is a HCI product)
        2. inclusiveness (accomodate widest possible # of people)
            ex: designed for all, regardless of disability, education, age, income
        note: achieve accessibility through universal design
            - some principles: equitable, flexible, simple, tolerance for error
        

    - 5 categories we can consider: physical, conceptual, economic, cultural, social

Usability
    - should be put into priority in general
    - goals:
        1. effectiveness
        2. efficiency
        3. safety
        4. utility
        5. learnability
        6. memorability

User interface
    1. visibility
        - make items clear
        - add instructions or color association
    2. feedback
        - sending live info to users (helps with user guidance)
    3. constraints
        - also helps with user guidance
    4. consistency
        - internal: same withing application
        - external: same accross apps/devices (ex: phone number pad (so if we have pad, do the same))
        - aesthetic
        - functional
    5. affordances
        - give a clue to usage (ex: mouse button --> invites to click/push)
