    Design process:
        - Spiral:
            1. analysis
            2. designs
            3. constructions
            4. validation

        - principles:
            1. familiarity
            2. consistency (if inconsistencies, then we want moderate)
            3. least surprise
            4. recoverability
            5. user assistance
            6. diversity
            7. structure hierarchy (cluttered/simple and easy to the eyes)
