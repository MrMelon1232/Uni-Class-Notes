IxD process

    Steps:
        1. understand
            - explore (needs, current market, current issues, reqs)
        2. research 
            - surveys, involve users
        3. analyze
        4. design
        5. develop

    double diamond of design:
        discover, define, develop, deliver
    
    involving users:
        - adds perspective
        - expectations management
        - ownsership (users active stakeholders)
        types:
            - active member (short,long term)
            - ind activities or group
            - online contribution
            - after product release

        User-centered design (UCD)
            - full focus on users
            - max usability and value
            - steps:
                1. find reqs
                2. designing alt
                3. prototyping alt
                4. evaluating product and UX
            - 3 principles:
                1. early focus on users/tasks
                2. empirical measurements
                3. IxD
            - google design sprint (unpack, sketch, decide, prototype, test)
            - another lifecycle: research in the wild
            issues: find who users are, their needs, alt designs, which to choose(A/B testing(online), other methods)
                    lot of ressources, users are not designers

            Integrate IxD within other models
                - agile process good: iteration, feedback, handles reqs
        
        Human-centered design (HCD)
            - focus on natural characteristics of humans
         Activity-centered design (ACD)
            - focus on human activity
        Genius design
            - relies on talented designers instead
