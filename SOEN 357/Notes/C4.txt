Design Process

    design flow:
        1. Understanding the problem
        2. research (interviews, surveys)
        3. analysis (why | journey maps, user scenarios, storyboards, personas)
        4. design
        5. validation

    Analysis techniques:

        personas: 
            - include goals, behaviors, motivations, background info
            - current state of UX, real data, user patterns NOT roles
        Empathy maps: 
            - group of users
            - 4 major areas: said, did, thought, felt
            - from this, we synthesize insights, needs, why, when, where, structure interviews
        journey maps:
            - sketch UX
            - timeline of interactions between user and product 
            - activities, feelings, experiences. expectation, stages
            - macro view, emotions
        User flow diagrams:
            - actions people take to reach goals
            - flow of app
            - micro view, technicalities
        scenario maps:
            - scenario of user carrying out goal/task
            - who, what, when, why, how
        storyboards:
            - sequence of illustrations, visualize a story
            - effective and cheap
            - pitch and critique, iterative approach
    
    Prototyping techniques:
        - 4 key components:
            1. people
            2. object
            3. location
            4. interaction
        - generate from scenario/use cases, from storyboards, card-based prototype
        
        Sketches/Diagrams:
            - little effort, launch ideas
            - can use paper interfaces

        Storyboard:
            - differences: user faces problem vs user reacts to solution

        Wireframes
            - layout produced 
            - more details and better structure
            - common language for designers, users, stakeholders, devs 
        
        Wizard of Oz:
            - responses from human (fake functions)
        
        High-fidelity:
            - use materials expected to be in final design
            - users might take its full product tho 
        
        Mockup:
            - mid/high-fidelity design (preview of final design)
            - include colors, texts, etc
            - usually use a software
    
    Compromises:
        horizontal: wide range of functions but little details
        vertical: lot of details for few functions
