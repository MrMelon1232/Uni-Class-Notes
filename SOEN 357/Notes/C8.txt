Memory

    recall vs recognition
        - find in memory vs find what is shown on screen then recog 
    - chunks of memory can be remembered as a group
    - organizing = easier to remember 
    - help memory with recognizable patterns, clear simple and not too crowded information

    improve UX:
        - reduce cognitive load
        - recognition > recall
        - label information (folders, categories)
