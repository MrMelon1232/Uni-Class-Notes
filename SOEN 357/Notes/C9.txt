HCI models

    Evaluation:
        - evaluate design and implementation
        - consider at all stages
        by system designers/experts: early, cognitive walkthrough (who, what, when, why, problems, etc)
        by end users: later

        example of cognitive walkthrough:
            1. identify user goals 
            2. identify tasks to accomplish goals
            3. document experience
        
        Heuristic evaluations
            - broad rules
            - systematic inspection
            ex: system status, user control
        
        Nielsen recommends individual inspection (for no bias)

    
    Model-based vs Review-based
        - evaluate usability, user behavior
        examples: human model, KLM (keyboard, mouse, etc), GOMS (pc), TLM(touchscreens)
    
    FITTS'S law
        - predictive model for human on HCI
        - time depends on precision
        - larger = easier
    
    Mental models
        - how you think smth will work based on learning/experience
    
    Conceptual Models:
        - research, use common terminology, test early
        - evaluation and execution (gulfs)

        Distribute cognition
            - includes more than user's mind (external sources) ex: google maps
            - distributed between users and groups
        
        Types of evaluations:
            - controlled (experimental)
            - natural

        Examples:
            - think aloud
            - cooperative
            - post task walkthrough
    
    Query techniques:
        - interviews
        - questionnaires
        - nasa tlx
        - subjective workload assessment technique (SWAT)
        - workload profile method
        - living labs
        - physiological measurements (emotional response linked to physical changes)
        - eye tracking
