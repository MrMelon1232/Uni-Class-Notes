Cognition

    Process:
        - attention
        - perception
        - memory
        - learning
        - reading, speaking, listening
        - problem-solving, planning, reasoning + decision making
    
    - helps with:
        - finding limits
        - knowing what is possible
        - explains nature and identifies nature of issues

    types:
        - experimental (play around exterior)
        - reflective
    
    - fast thinking:
        - automatic, fast but error prone
    - slow thinking:
        - reliable, slow, complex decisions

    - Causes of cognitive fluency: (min effort for brain)
        1. fresh vs familiar: evolve gradually familiar design
        2. Clear characters: space = more relax, colors (emotions, simplicity)
        3. good mood
        4. priming effect (influenced responsed from another stimulus)
    
    Attention:
        - millenials --> shift attention but longer concentration


Perception
    -  4 principles:
        1. emergence (whole picture)
        2. reification (mind fills the gap)
        3. multi-stability (multiple views)
        4. invariance (diffs/similarities)
        5. figure/ground = front/background
    
    laws:
        1. jakobs: familiarity
        2. pragnanz: regular, simple, symetrical
        3. proximity
        4. similarity
        5. closure: objects are complete and focus on objects rather than gaps
        6. symmetry
        7. common fate: objects move along line
        8. continuity: objects grouped = percept as whole
        9. past experience
