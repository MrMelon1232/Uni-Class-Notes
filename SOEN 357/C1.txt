UI/UX design

Definitions:
    UI: user interface (the screen)
        - how the product looks (buttons, text, colors)
    UX: user experience (in front of screen (aka user))
    UI x UX = interaction design
        - how a product behaves when interacted with (animation, transitions, etc)

Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

    Cognitive engineering:
        - came with challenge of personal computing
        - how nervous system represents, process and transforms information
            - analysis, design and evaluation of complex people and technology systems
        - HCI one of the first examples
        consider: human factors/ergonomics
        - document development

        Original Focus:
            - usability: easy to use and learn
    
    HCI (human-computer interaction)
        - from comp sci/productivity app --> visualization, information systems, etc
        - emerging technologies: graphical UI --> myriad interaction techniques and devices, multi-modal interactions, etc.

        Early desktop:
            - desktop was messy (design idea)
            - then search was implemented
            - now we have email for communications, phones, etc
            - HCI moved beyond desktop
        - benefits: investigate, develop and harness new areas of possibility to enhance UX
