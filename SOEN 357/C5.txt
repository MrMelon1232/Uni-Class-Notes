Data collection

    - helps with planning, preparing (interviews, designs)
    5 issues:
        1. setting goals (what)
        2. identity participants (how to sample) (who)
        3. relationship with participants (bias)
        4. triangulation 
            - diff type of data (interviews, experiements)
            - diff sources (people, places, sampling)
            - perspective of data
        5. pilot studies
            - check structure
            - validate methods
    
    examples:
        - audio
        - notes (descriptive, inferential, evaluative), pictures
        - interviews (closed, open, structured/unstructured)
                     - groups might have bias (emotional, artificial)
                     - we want atomic, simple questions
                     - varied, explore issues but subjective and time consuming
        - Questionnaires (demongraphics, simple, scales)
                        - likert (opinions, attitudes, beliefs) ex: disagree --> agree
                        - semantic (measure meaning of objects, events) ex: rude --> courteous
                        - simple and easy but less flexible, less probing
        - Observations 
            - person, place, thing
            - passive or active
            - think aloud, user describes what they are doing (solo or co-op)
        - Ethnography
            - immerse self in culture to study
