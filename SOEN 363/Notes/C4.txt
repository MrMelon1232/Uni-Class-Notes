      see C4_sqlex1, C4_sqlex2, C4_sqlex3
      - less table = no need to get info from multiple relations but space might be wasted (what if several departments have no managers)

      Participation constraints
        - add "NOT NULL" to the foreign key when using 1 table approach
      
      Weak Entities:
        - use 1 table approach
        see ex: C4_weak

      ISA:
        - create relation for the original entity and all sub entities
        - subentities has the original entity's primary key as a foreign key and primary key
        - subentities should be "cascaded" in the case of deletion of employee
        - note: we can always just create the subentities and mention the superentity
