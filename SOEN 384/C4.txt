Estimation Techniques part 2
- Problem with LOC: have to wait for system implementation
    Function points:
        - functionality offered by system
        - collection of exec. statements
        - function points can be calculated before system is developed

    5 components
        1. External inputs
        2. External outputs (data output)
        3. Logical internal files (datastore)
        4. External interfaces files (files accessed by system but not maintained)
        5. External inquiries (query)

    Simplest way to calculate:
        (# of external inputs x 4) +
        (# of external outputs x 5) + 
        (# of logical internal files x 10) + 
        (# of external interface files x 7) + 
        (# of external inquiries x 4)

    Example: look at C4_fp file
        from the file, we found:
            external inputs: 1
            external outputs: 2
            logical internal files: 1
            external interface files: 0
            external inquiries: 1
        Total functionality: (1x4) + (2x5) + (1x10) + (0x7) + (1x4) = 28

Cosmic Functional points
    - functional size measurement method
    - subprocess can be either datamovement or data manipulation
    - functional processes and data movements
        - processe are:
            - independant
            - triggered by an event
        - Data movements (single data group): E(entry), X(exit), R(read), W(write)
        - Triggering events are entry type
        - Clock and timing events are triggering 
    
    Steps:
        1. identify functional users
        2. identify triggering events
        3. identify functional processes
        4. identify data groups
        5. identify data movements
        6. Obtain total # of Cosmic FP (every data movement = 1)
        example: if customer wants to login
                 verify customer: 
                        1. entry by pressing ok (entry)
                        2. system receives data (read)
                        3. confirmation message (exit)
