Project Foundations

Product (operational and system reqs) and Process (contractual agreements, development model) foundations 

Requirement Engineering (RE)
    - why, what, who
    {SOFREQ, ASM, DOM} | = SysReq
        SOFREQ = sofware req set
        ASM = assumption
        DOM = domain properties
        SysReq is satisfied if all items are satisfied and consistent with each other

    - developement:
        1. Elicitation (understanding)
        2. Analysis (user needs/expectations --> technical reqs)
        3. Allocations
        4. Specification (documentation of reqs)
        5. Verification 
        6. Negotiation
        7. acceptance
    - CCB = change control board (decideds for inclusion of new changes)

Development process models
    1. Code-and-fix problems (bad)
        - code then fix
    2. Waterfall
        - rigid and formal ; good for embedded and safety-critical systems
        - cons: activities isolated = late changes --> lot of rework
    3. Prototype
    4. Spiral Model
    5. Incremental dev
    6. Test-Driven dev
    7. Agile

Project Scope
    Product foundations (operational and system reqs, design constraints) determine scope 
    Let:
        R = ressources available
        T = dev time (hours)
        Effort(t) = effort (person-hours) to realize features (f ∈ features )
        ∑effort(f) / (R x T) | ∑effort(f) < (R x T)
        Project Scope < 100% is acceptable
        Overscoping:
            ∑effort(f) > (R x T)

        Baseline:
            ∑effort(f) > (R x T) where f ∈ B
            Requirements baseline = itemized set of features intended to be delivered for specific version
            Defining one:
                assign priority (business value, effort, risk)

    budget:
        Cost =  ∑effort(f) x salary(+overhead)

    Determining effort:
        - Find duration of activity then determine work effort with # of people
        example 1: a person working full time (8 hours) in a small program for 1 day
            Duration of activity = 1 workday
            Work effort = 8 person-hours
        example 2: 5 persons working full time for 6 weeks, 35 hours of work per week
            Duration of the activity = 6 weeks
            Work effort = (5 persons * 6 weeks *  35 hours/week) = 1050 person-hours
