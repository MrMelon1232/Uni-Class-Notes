What is a project ?
 - Defined objectives, schedule, budget allocated
 - roles indentified and responsabilities/authority assgined

 software project management
    - set of activities, processes and constraints
    - planning, coordinating, develop, modify, maintain
    Characteristics:
        - Invisibility (helps remove invis (progress tracking))
        - Complexity (more complex / $)
        - Conformity (conform to req of humans (no physical material = no laws))
    - minimize planned vs actual cost diff
    - common problems:
        1. acceptance of impossible constraints
        2. budget overrun, delays
        3. customer req change = loss of control
    - 4 main activities:
        1. Planning and Estimating
        2. Measuring and Controlling
        3. Leading (communicating, morale, coordinating) and Communicating
        4. Managing(planning, estimating) Risk
    - Challenges:
        1. Scope (what to be done)
        2. budget
        3. Resources
        4. Technology
        5. Delivery Date


Measurement:
    - important to be able to track progress and identify anomalies
    - feedback --> linked to metrics, measures to track 
    ex: McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity: produces untested test conditions to increase effectiveness
    Conceptual level: establish measurement goals alligned with business needs
    Operational level: Generate set of questions to help determine achievement goals
    Quantative level: establish set of data to answer each question in quantative way

    - reason for measurements:
        1. target
        2. planning
        3. attention/focus
        4. performance
        5. imporovement tracking
        6. decision

Quality control
    - conformity to requirements, standards
    1. Design: requirements, specifications, design
    2. Conformance: how well implementation follows design and result
    - software: inspections, reviews, tests | in order to meet goal and improve ability to deliver
    REASONS: 
        - meet requirements
        - feedback loops
        - meansurements and feedback combined
        - specifications

    QC vs QA (assurance):
        - set of activities designed to evaluate process
    
    Techniques:
        Review: examined for comment or approval
        Inspection: formal peer review with defined process to find defects

Organizational Structures
    - Process-Structured org (functional) | grouped by functions
    - Product-Structured (functional)
    - Project-Strucuted
    - Matrix-Structured (both functional and project based structures)
