Managing Process risk part 1

    Definition:
        ISO/IEC: risk = prob of event and neg impact
        PMBok: may or may not happens, can be identified in advance and is pos/neg
               threat = neg
               opportunity = pos
               Risk averse = some1 who does not want to be neg impacted
    
    Management process
        - Risk assessment (early of project)
            gold plating = working on project past pt of deminishing returns (ex: work on extra stuff not asked and it turns out bad)
            1. identification
            2. analysis
                - assess likelihood & impact
                - RE (risk exposure) = prob * impact
                - establish threshold
            3. prioritization
                - likelihood and impact
        - Risk control 
            1. planning
                - develop strategy for neg risks (acceptance, avoidance, transfer, mitigation)
                - RRL (risk reduction leverage) = (RE b4 - RE after) / cost of reduction
                - EMV (expected monetary value) = P*I with prob * impact for trees | EMV(A) = sum of all strategy A
            2. resolution
            3. monitoring
                1. risk response audits (document risk response and effectiveness)
                2. periodic risk review
                3. additional risk response planning
