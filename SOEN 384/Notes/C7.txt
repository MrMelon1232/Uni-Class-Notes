Measuring and Controllig Work Processes part 1

    - planning is the most important process
    - we monitor cost and schedule

    Tracking indicators for schedule and cost:
        - Planned Value (PV): effort planned for task in cost (budget is a PV)
        - Earned Value (EV): % of PV of the work actually completed by a given pt in time
                        so if task is 70% done then we have earned 70% * PV of cost
        - Actual Cost (AC or ACWP): total costs of of completed tasks at a given pt in time

    Look at C7_EVPV
    if EV > PV --> ahead of schedule (doesnt mean its good) (behind for opposite)
    if AC > PV and EV --> over budget (under for opposite)

    Calculations:

        1. Cost Variance (CV)
            EV - AC
        2. Schedule Variance (SV)
            EV - PV
        3. Cost Performance Index (CPI)
            EV / AC
            we want a value close to 1.0 (over = cost higher than planned | lower = less)
        
        4. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
            EV / PV
            rate of progress
            value 1.0 --> efficient | > 1 --> favorable | < 1 --> not favorable
