Project Planning techniques 1
    - reqs = product specifications
    - plan = process specifications

    Project plan:
        - not done properly(not enough time, lack of skills/tools, lack of info, bad understanding of project)
        - documentation is important because: assess info (cost, schedule, resource estimate), for stakeholders
        project plan good when:
            1. formal contract agreement between acquirer/supplier
            2. large, complex projects internal to org

        Sequence for planning:
            1. develop scope documents
            2. plan ressources
            3. plan costs
        
        Initial activities:
            - develop a work breakdown structure (WBS)
            - develop work packages for the tasks in the WBS
            - we want to find project activities in order to balance all activities, budget, schedule, etc.(project management)
                inputs:
                    - project management plan
                    - scope baseline (WBS, deliverables, constraints/assumption)
                    - enterprise environmental factors (culture/policies)
                    - organizational process assets
        After scope basedlined:
            - we get activity list after decomposing work packages from WBS
            - helps build schedule and management

                outputs:
                    - activity list (links activity to work package)
                        = contains activity ID, WBS ID, name, descrip.
                    - activities attributesÃ¥
                    - milestone list
                    - pm plan updates
                    - change requests
        
    
    Work Breakdown structure (WBS):
        - hierarchical decomposition of work activities
        - done after scope and reqs defined
        - tree or indented list
        - decisions tied to WBS (for risks, activities, costs)
        - based on project deliverables (top -> down)
        - result to what is required to reach it
        - each task = single owner
        ex: see C5_wbs

        Tools used to define activities
            - decomposition (breaking down deliverables into smaller pieces(until work packages))
            - meetings
            - expert judgement
        
        Activity attributes:
            - predecessor
            - successor
            - logical relationships
                1. finish to start (most common | start next once predecessor is done)
                2. finish to finish
                3. start to finish
                4. start to start
            - leads and lags (leads and delays)
            - imposed dates (no control)
            - ressouce reqs
            - location
            - level of effort (discrete (can be done by 1 person), apportioned)
                ex: discrete: technician will take 1 hour for assembly
                    apportioned: qa
            - constraints/assumptions
        
        Milestone list
            - based on schedule management plan and scope
            - ID, activity ID, event, name, date
            - also called zero-duration events (no duration/critical pts)
