Boxplot (short summary)
    - describes distribution of a continuous variable(s) by plotting 5-num summary(min, lower quart, median, etc)
    - can display outliers (outside range of +/- 1.5*(IQR) where IQR = upper quartile - lower quartile)
    - notch --> if 2 boxes dont overlap = medians differ

Inpections and code reviews
    - structued reading of artifacts --> imp QA technique
    - can detect errors
    Process:
        - more formal from 1 to 3
        1. walk-through
            - gives understanding of contents of analysed artifacts to participants
            - no specific technique and applied to all
        2. Peer review
            - find defects and comment on style
            - artefact review done by colleague
            Leader preparation:
                - determine which sections w/ author
                - select team members and distribute doc
                - schedule sessions
        3. Technical review
            - indiv checking, group discussion and decision
            - roles depending on type of artefacts
            - diff reading techniques, usually checklist-based
        4. inspection 
            - indiv and grp checking using diff source/standards
            - roles: author(questions, correct minor issues after), inspection leader, inspector, scribe
            - planning --> kick off(overview) --> indiv checking --> logging meeting(final review) --> edit/follow up(change requests)
        
        Reading techniques:
            1. Checklist-based
            2. usage-based 
            3. defect-based
            4. perspective-reading

        Review report defects:
            - can be identified by:
                1. extremely short review, no defects and approval only
                2. short report, no action items
                3. no follow-up to action items and no follow-up activities
