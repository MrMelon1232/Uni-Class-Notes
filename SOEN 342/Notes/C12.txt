Ressource Description Framework (RDF)
    
    - graph-based data model used in Web 3.0 (semantic Web)
    - describes data by defining relationships between objects
    - data integration from multiple sources
    - built around Web standards (XML, URL)
    - can be queried
    dev strategy:
        - domain model linked to code (not like UML)
        - Schemas used at runtime 
    - helps connect data (example book info, wikipedia) by merging (need matching URIs)
    RDF triples
        - labelled connection between 2 ressources
        s,p,o --> subject, property, object |IRIs
        - URIs make the merge possible | grounds RDF into Web (Universal Ressource Identifier)
    
    RDF Schema (RDFS)
        - use common vocab to merge (since we cant merge w/ non-matching URIs)
        - type information to restrict s,p,o (domain and range)
        - organize items in hierarchy (taxonomy) for relation 
        
        RDFS solves issues
            - provides language for writing vocab, type info, taxonomy
            - RDF can read RDFS but maybe prod. diff results | RDFS is RDF
            - everything in RDF is a ressource | RDFS defines ressources and classes
